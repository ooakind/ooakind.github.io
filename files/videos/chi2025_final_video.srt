00:00:02,277 --> 00:00:03,927
The HCI community

2
00:00:03,927 --> 00:00:05,346
has developed various techniques

3
00:00:05,346 --> 00:00:07,954
and systems to promote empathy.

4
00:00:07,954 --> 00:00:09,571
A major assumption has been that

5
00:00:09,571 --> 00:00:11,386
letting the user experience

6
00:00:11,386 --> 00:00:12,277
another person's

7
00:00:12,277 --> 00:00:13,993
episode would help the user feel

8
00:00:13,993 --> 00:00:16,205
the same emotion as the other person.

9
00:00:16,205 --> 00:00:17,921
However, we consider that

10
00:00:17,921 --> 00:00:19,208
presenting someone else's

11
00:00:19,208 --> 00:00:20,792
experience in the same way

12
00:00:20,792 --> 00:00:22,046
might not necessarily

13
00:00:22,046 --> 00:00:24,357
evoke the same emotion in the user.

14
00:00:24,357 --> 00:00:26,568
Microaggression is a good example.

15
00:00:26,568 --> 00:00:27,360
Let's see José

16
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,373
and Ashley's conversation.

17
00:00:29,373 --> 00:00:31,519
Alpha, Bravo, Charlie.

18
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:33,631
Wow, was your dad a pilot?

19
00:00:33,631 --> 00:00:34,852
Ashley feels upset

20
00:00:34,852 --> 00:00:36,568
because she finds a subtle bias

21
00:00:36,568 --> 00:00:38,746
toward women in José’s question,

22
00:00:38,746 --> 00:00:40,991
but José has no idea what is wrong

23
00:00:40,991 --> 00:00:43,565
because he didn't intend any harm to her.

24
00:00:43,565 --> 00:00:44,093
The point is,

25
00:00:44,093 --> 00:00:46,205
even with the same experience,

26
00:00:46,205 --> 00:00:47,262
people may perceive it

27
00:00:47,262 --> 00:00:48,450
differently depending

28
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:50,793
on their individual background.

29
00:00:50,793 --> 00:00:51,783
In this paper,

30
00:00:51,783 --> 00:00:52,806
we present a novel

31
00:00:52,806 --> 00:00:53,928
concept of fostering

32
00:00:53,928 --> 00:00:54,819
empathy via

33
00:00:54,819 --> 00:00:56,239
generating personalized

34
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:58,054
analogical experiences,

35
00:00:58,054 --> 00:00:59,374
inducing an individual

36
00:00:59,374 --> 00:01:00,892
to feel emotions similar

37
00:01:00,892 --> 00:01:03,137
to those of the target person.

38
00:01:03,137 --> 00:01:05,645
The idea is that instead of understanding

39
00:01:05,645 --> 00:01:07,097
the experiences of others

40
00:01:07,097 --> 00:01:08,747
from totally different backgrounds

41
00:01:08,747 --> 00:01:11,058
solely through our own perspectives,

42
00:01:11,058 --> 00:01:13,137
we can use our personal experiences

43
00:01:13,137 --> 00:01:15,282
to connect with them emotionally.

44
00:01:15,282 --> 00:01:17,889
As a case study to showcase our concept,

45
00:01:17,889 --> 00:01:19,012
We developed EmoSync,

46
00:01:19,012 --> 00:01:20,662
an LLM-based

47
00:01:20,662 --> 00:01:22,774
agent that generates personalized

48
00:01:22,774 --> 00:01:24,721
analogical microaggression,

49
00:01:24,721 --> 00:01:26,603
so that it facilitates users

50
00:01:26,603 --> 00:01:27,824
to personally resonate

51
00:01:27,824 --> 00:01:28,847
with another person

52
00:01:28,847 --> 00:01:30,596
in a different microaggression.

53
00:01:30,596 --> 00:01:33,071
Let's see the conceptual flow of EmoSync

54
00:01:33,071 --> 00:01:35,316
in José and Ashley's conversation.

55
00:01:35,316 --> 00:01:36,537
José’s EmoSync agent

56
00:01:36,537 --> 00:01:39,639
takes personal information about José,

57
00:01:39,639 --> 00:01:42,478
the microaggression he delivered to Ashley,

58
00:01:42,478 --> 00:01:44,359
and the emotion that Ashley felt.

59
00:01:44,359 --> 00:01:45,976
Then EmoSync generates

60
00:01:45,976 --> 00:01:47,197
an analogical vignette,

61
00:01:47,197 --> 00:01:48,550
which may foster José

62
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:51,125
to feel similar emotions to Ashley.

63
00:01:51,125 --> 00:01:53,171
With the help of the generated vignette,

64
00:01:53,171 --> 00:01:55,283
José could intuitively understand

65
00:01:55,283 --> 00:01:57,593
why she's upset and empathize with her,

66
00:01:57,593 --> 00:02:00,102
drawing from his own Hispanic background.

67
00:02:00,102 --> 00:02:02,643
We designed and evaluated EmoSync

68
00:02:02,643 --> 00:02:04,326
by 3-phased online user study

69
00:02:04,326 --> 00:02:06,604
with more than 100 participants.

70
00:02:06,604 --> 00:02:07,528
In phase 1,

71
00:02:07,528 --> 00:02:10,036
we make sure the LLM agent understands

72
00:02:10,036 --> 00:02:11,554
and infers an individual's

73
00:02:11,554 --> 00:02:13,601
personalized emotional responses

74
00:02:13,601 --> 00:02:15,185
upon microaggression.

75
00:02:15,185 --> 00:02:16,538
To do so, we collected

76
00:02:16,538 --> 00:02:18,881
a dataset from 41 participants

77
00:02:18,881 --> 00:02:20,564
containing personal information

78
00:02:20,564 --> 00:02:22,512
over four major dimensions.

79
00:02:22,512 --> 00:02:23,898
Based on this dataset,

80
00:02:23,898 --> 00:02:25,614
We designed an LLM prompt

81
00:02:25,614 --> 00:02:26,934
and fine-tuned the types

82
00:02:26,934 --> 00:02:29,046
and amount of personal information.

83
00:02:29,046 --> 00:02:30,070
In phase 2,

84
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:31,291
we designed the prompt

85
00:02:31,291 --> 00:02:32,875
to generate personalized

86
00:02:32,875 --> 00:02:34,525
analogical microaggression

87
00:02:34,525 --> 00:02:35,482
based on the prompt

88
00:02:35,482 --> 00:02:37,496
developed in phase 1.

89
00:02:37,496 --> 00:02:38,783
The final EmoSync

90
00:02:38,783 --> 00:02:40,235
prompt aims to generate

91
00:02:40,235 --> 00:02:41,918
analogical microaggressions

92
00:02:41,918 --> 00:02:43,601
that elicit emotions

93
00:02:43,601 --> 00:02:44,261
that aligned

94
00:02:44,261 --> 00:02:45,879
with the target emotion,

95
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:48,024
resonate personally with the user,

96
00:02:48,024 --> 00:02:50,004
and have some analogical connections

97
00:02:50,004 --> 00:02:51,984
to the original microaggression.

98
00:02:51,984 --> 00:02:53,107
Here is an example

99
00:02:53,107 --> 00:02:54,922
generated by EmoSync.

100
00:02:56,011 --> 00:02:57,397
In the pilot experiment

101
00:02:57,397 --> 00:02:58,585
with 10 participants,

102
00:02:58,585 --> 00:02:59,179
we observed

103
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:01,160
that the analogical microaggression

104
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,348
elicited emotions

105
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:04,328
closer to the target emotions.

106
00:03:04,328 --> 00:03:05,285
In phase 3,

107
00:03:05,285 --> 00:03:07,331
we explored the efficacy of EmoSync

108
00:03:07,331 --> 00:03:08,817
in multifaceted

109
00:03:08,817 --> 00:03:11,490
empathy factors with 60 participants.

110
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:13,272
We designed an online survey

111
00:03:13,272 --> 00:03:15,450
to simulate real life communication

112
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:17,266
that EmoSync assists users

113
00:03:17,266 --> 00:03:18,817
when they struggle to empathize

114
00:03:18,817 --> 00:03:19,906
with a microaggression.

115
00:03:19,906 --> 00:03:21,028
We assessed

116
00:03:21,028 --> 00:03:22,612
how their empathy changed

117
00:03:22,612 --> 00:03:24,097
after seeing a corresponding

118
00:03:24,097 --> 00:03:26,078
analogical microaggression.

119
00:03:26,078 --> 00:03:27,035
As results,

120
00:03:27,035 --> 00:03:28,883
the analogical microaggression

121
00:03:28,883 --> 00:03:29,873
elicit emotions

122
00:03:29,873 --> 00:03:32,150
closer to the target emotions.

123
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:33,108
After presenting

124
00:03:33,108 --> 00:03:34,890
the analogical microaggression,

125
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:36,111
participants’ empathy

126
00:03:36,111 --> 00:03:37,728
to original microaggression

127
00:03:37,728 --> 00:03:40,072
improved in multiple dimensions.

128
00:03:40,072 --> 00:03:42,745
The generally perceived EmoSync positively, 

129
00:03:42,745 --> 00:03:45,088
highlighting its analogical connections,

130
00:03:45,088 --> 00:03:47,860
personal resonance, and empathic support.

131
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:50,765
Participants appreciated that EmoSync helps

132
00:03:50,765 --> 00:03:52,679
expanding empathy beyond one's

133
00:03:52,679 --> 00:03:54,230
experience space

134
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:55,682
and encouraging reflection

135
00:03:55,682 --> 00:03:57,366
and deepening understanding.

136
00:03:57,366 --> 00:03:58,521
They also highlighted

137
00:03:58,521 --> 00:03:59,874
the need for practical

138
00:03:59,874 --> 00:04:01,854
real world applications.

139
00:04:01,854 --> 00:04:03,273
Possible applications

140
00:04:03,273 --> 00:04:05,056
where EmoSync could be directly

141
00:04:05,056 --> 00:04:06,409
adopted and beneficial

142
00:04:06,409 --> 00:04:07,564
would be online chat,

143
00:04:07,564 --> 00:04:10,468
news or social networking platforms.

144
00:04:10,468 --> 00:04:12,515
EmoSync also could be extended

145
00:04:12,515 --> 00:04:14,726
beyond one-on-one communication, 

146
00:04:14,726 --> 00:04:17,663
microaggression domain and text modality.

147
00:04:17,663 --> 00:04:18,620
In conclusion,

148
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:20,568
we propose a novel empathy-enhancing

149
00:04:20,568 --> 00:04:22,218
 approach that generates

150
00:04:22,218 --> 00:04:24,594
personalized analogical experiences

151
00:04:24,594 --> 00:04:26,013
to induce individuals

152
00:04:26,013 --> 00:04:27,334
from different backgrounds

153
00:04:27,334 --> 00:04:29,710
to share similar emotions.

154
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:31,558
A case study on microaggression

155
00:04:31,558 --> 00:04:33,802
with the prototype agent EmoSync,

156
00:04:33,802 --> 00:04:35,453
showcased the multifaceted 

157
00:04:35,453 --> 00:04:37,301
empathy-enhancing effects,

158
00:04:37,301 --> 00:04:38,588
highlighting the potential

159
00:04:38,588 --> 00:04:40,370
for our approach to be applied

160
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:41,492
in various real world

161
00:04:41,492 --> 00:04:42,945
scenarios that require

162
00:04:42,945 --> 00:04:45,255
empathy among diverse people.

163
00:04:45,255 --> 00:04:46,344
For more details,

164
00:04:46,344 --> 00:04:48,687
please refer to our paper. Thank you.
